I recently built this interactive dashboard to analyze key performance metrics from credit card transactions, including revenue generation, transaction amounts, customer segmentation, and card usage behavior.

🔍 Key Insights:

    💳 Total Revenue: ₹55.32M+

    🔁 Total Transactions: ₹44.52M+

    💰 Interest Earned: ₹7.84M+

    📈 Top Revenue Sources: Bills, Entertainment, Fuel

    🧑‍🎓 Highest Spending Group: Graduates with ₹22.3M+

    💼 Top Customer Segment: Businessmen contributing ₹17.4M in revenue

    💸 Most Used Card: Blue card with ₹46M acquisition cost and highest revenue contribution

✅ Filters added for gender, quarter, income group, and card category to provide dynamic analysis capabilities.
